RUNNING

Just double click the flight.jar file. You need a java jre to run jar files though you'll probably have it already. If not, the official java site is java.com.



CONTROLS

a, d     -    for left and right
w        -    for jumping, jet packing, and climbing walls
mouse    -    to shoot hook. keep mouse pressed until you want to release hook.
space bar-    (with your hook out) will throw you towards the hook. takes practice.



MAPS

You can edit or make your own maps in ms paint or any other software that can save in png format. Just call the file map1.png and place it in the same folder as flight.jar.

I don't know much about good level design, so do feel free to post your custom maps too.
