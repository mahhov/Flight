3.5 minute demo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weg7nRoi4Es

State
the code is messed up. the project was abandoned while converting it to have multiplayer capabilities, and so it was left in a disfunctional state. OldHostWorld.java still runs though buggy.


project goal
asymmetrical mobility-emphasis combat platformer.

Old Version
the folder "runnable-old-version" contains the .jar file from an older version, but not nearly as buggy as the current source code. Make sure to download map1.png as well and locate it in the same folder as the .jar in order to be able to run it, or create your own if you wish.
